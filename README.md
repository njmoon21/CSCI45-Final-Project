# CSCI45 Final Project
 Godot Platformer

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This is a basic 2D platformer created for our final project for a CSCI college course.

To run the game, execute the 'Ninja Frog.exe' file
(Be sure not to move the file out of the folder, as it will break the game)

We hope you appreciate our project!
This is our very first time learning and using the Godot Game Engine, and we definitely learned a lot
from this project. There were definitely many ups and downs, however we are glad that 
we were able to reach the end.

NOTE:
Although we used public domain sprite assets, we ended up using music from other video games.
To view the name of the soundtracks used, go to the settings from the main menu, where all
the following tracks are listed.
